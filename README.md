## Overview

## Features

- **Proposal Creation:** Members can create and submit proposals for community initiatives or resource allocation.

- **Voting:** All members have equal voting power to approve or reject proposals, ensuring democratic decision-making.

- **Contribution:** Members can contribute Ether (ETH) to the DAO's treasury to fund approved proposals.

- **Manager Role:** A designated manager initiates proposals and ensures the DAO operates smoothly.

## Getting Started

To participate in CommunityDAO:

1. **Contribute:** Become a member by contributing Ether (ETH) to the DAO's treasury.

2. **Propose:** Submit proposals for community projects or funding.

3. **Vote:** Cast your vote on proposals to influence their approval.

4. **Manager:** The manager role is responsible for proposal creation and oversight.

## Usage

- **Smart Contracts:** The DAO's functionality is governed by smart contracts on the Ethereum blockchain.

- **Transparency:** All DAO activities, including proposals, votes, and transactions, are publicly recorded.
